#Different ways to print

print("Hello")
print("There")
print("You.")

#adding a line to see the terminal a bit clearer
print()

print("Hello"); print("There"); print("You.")


#I want to test if i can put them all on the same line or not
print("hello"), print(" "), print("there!")
#Ok all that did was do the same, hm so (, and ;) is the same
