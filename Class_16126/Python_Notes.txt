Python vs. Java
- you have a lot more code to write in java vs python, java needs waterplate code(writing where you get the info from, how you use it etc)
- python usees less and basically is a write it how you see it code

; == new line (end statement)
{} == indentation (code block)
explicit == inferred (variable) 

python interprets the variable type, and will inferr the most logical
type.
Syntax :
(age = 15)  == (int age = 15)

Language:
- java is a compiled code, (create, compile and excecute)
- python just runs the file, there is no compiling and it just interprets at once(create, run)


BASICS:
- Memory - Processing Power - Logic 
- Algorythm : "recipe", telling the system what to do 
- variable - a place to store the data

Example Printing: (in python terminal)
>>> a = "hei"
>>> b = 3
>>> c = "Julie"
>>> print("My name is ",c,", I am ",b," years old..",a) 
My name is  Julie , I am  3  years old.. hei
>>> print("My name is {c} i am {b} years old. {a}")
My name is {c} i am {b} years old. {a}
>>> print(f"My name is {c} i am {b} years old.. {a}")
My name is Julie i am 3 years old.. hei
>>>exit()


SIZE of VAriables:
- in terminal python:
- import sys
- sys.getsizeof(<the variable you want to test>)  
- type <the variable you want to test>  

- variables can change types without us doing anything
- you can resign it no matter what, even if it is the program or terminal
- if you write:
    x = 5
    print(x)
    x = "Hello world"
    print(x)
- both lines will run and there will not be any error because we change the value
    and then it will change to the next. but it will forever change.

score_text = "95"  #just text
score_number = int(score_text) #Integere parse
score_total = score_number + 5   


Code: INput
name = input("Whats your name:")
age = input("Whats your age:")

year = 2026 - int(age)
print(f"{name}, you were born the year {year} Or {year - 1}.")
year = 2025 - int(age)
print(f"Or the year {year}.")
