Teacher:

Lectures:
- friday (physical)
- monday (digital(for his classes))


Making Application:
- DJango(look what it is)

example code:
def Calculate_average(a,b,c):
  total = a + b + c
  average = total / 3
  return average

calculates average, (what does def mean?)  

Environments:
- python environments to isolate programs and see how different environments
  reacts to the program. Environments: version of python, version of environments
  etc.
- they get isolated and self sustained, in the environment
- if you dont have an environment, and you develop it anf you give it to someone else
  and they have a different python for example. if it is not configured to run other 
  environments, it will not run. and if it is configured, the environment travels with the 
  code so anyone can access it.

Pros: (Environments)
- isolate projects
- clean and reproducible
- good practice (proffessionall)  


To create and environment:
python -m venv (name of new environment)

for Windows:
(navnet til environment\Scripts\activate
for Mac:
source (name of environment)\bin\activate


creating an environment allows for changing code and importing extensions
that do not affect the main code(computer), its basically docker without the extra steps


Commando_line:
 Id CommandLine
  -- -----------
   1 try { . "c:\Users\ingas\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\reso...
   2 venv\Scripts\activate
   3 ls
   4 python --version
   5 where python
   6 pwd
   7 pwd python
   8 find python
   9 import pandas (opened python and tried importing, did not work because not installed)
  10 pip install pandas (install it after exiting python)
  11 python (open python, and can then import pandas and utilize it)
