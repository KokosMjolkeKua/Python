Functions:
- to do someting in your code that can be called
- you dont have to write it more than on e time 
- if you are writing a function, you can define it
    making it universal for that command
- its a promise between user and writer, making it understandable
    between the two 

    TypeHint + DocStrings = Contract
    (makes it easily understandable)        

WHY contracts matter:
- Predictability
- testability
- reausability
- debugging
(makes everything easier, more oversiktlig)


Debugging:
- see how the code works, where the program takes you
- to see where things and misunderstandings could go wrong
- "finding and fixing bugs in the code"
