Functions:
- to do someting in your code that can be called
- you dont have to write it more than on e time 
- if you are writing a function, you can define it
    making it universal for that command
- its a promise between user and writer, making it understandable
    between the two 

    TypeHint + DocStrings = Contract
    (makes it easily understandable)        

WHY contracts matter:
- Predictability
- testability
- reausability
- debugging
(makes everything easier, more oversiktlig)


Debugging:
- see how the code works, where the program takes you
- to see where things and misunderstandings could go wrong
- "finding and fixing bugs in the code"

Debug shortcut keys:
Start/Continue	F5	Start debugging or, if paused, continue execution until the next breakpoint.
Start Without Debugging	Ctrl + F5	Run code normally, without entering debug mode.
Stop	Shift + F5	Terminate the current debugging session.
Restart	Ctrl + Shift + F5	Stop and immediately restart debugging with the same configuration.
Step Over	F10	Execute the current line and move to the next without stepping into function calls.
Step Into	F11	Jump into the next function call in the current line of code.
Step Out	Shift + F11	Jump out of the current function and return to the calling code's execution context.
Toggle Breakpoint	F9	Add or remove a breakpoint on the current line.
Toggle Inline Breakpoint	Shift + F9	Add an inline breakpoint at the current cursor position during a session.
