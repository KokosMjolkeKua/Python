DATA 1300:
DocStrings & Type Hints

Docstring:
- text to help understand what goes on in the code
- use it forward to show your thinking process
- it should be possible to understand the function based on the DocStrings(for any human)

Type-Hints:
- you can tell python to put their sight on one datatype more than another
- basically a hint to make sure there are no errors(syntax or otherwise)
