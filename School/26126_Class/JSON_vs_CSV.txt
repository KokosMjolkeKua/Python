JSON vs. CSV:
- extremely common in python

CSV (commma seperated form):
- values, seperated by commas
- spreadsheets
- flat and simple
- no hierarchy

JSON ()
- hierarchy
- neste and flexible
- can have nested types
ex:
[
    {"name":"Alice","age":30,"temp":37.5},
    {"name":"Bob","age":25,"temp":36.8},
]

WHEN TO USE:
- CSV: small files, tabular, fast processing, human readability
- JSON: Nested structure(more complex), APIs, 
    config files(application f eks that needs configurations), flexible schema
    ex: (photo app, you need a config file to say how big it is, what its supposed to show, doesn
    the app end when its this and this size)
- Both: Human readability. no special tools needed 

TO READ THE file
with open('data.json','r') as f:
data = json.load(f)

TO Write
with open('patient.csv','w',newline='') as f:
writer = csv.write(f)


FLAT JSON (simple):
{"name":"Alice","temp":37.5}

can use a JSON file as a database, (very simple)


TO SEE THE COMANDS:
- import json
- dir(json)

- import csv
- dir(csv)


- dir can be used for any datatypes to see what 
- you can do with it .functions, class and otherwise


USING dir and help:
- use dir to see what exists 
- and use help to figure out how you can do it(details)
