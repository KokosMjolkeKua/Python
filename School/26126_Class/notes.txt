LEARNIG OBJECTIVES:
- master if/else/elif
- right data structure
- JSON and CSV file format
- how to Write prof docstrings
- use type hints for code clarity
- logging, how to apply for debugging and monitoring


IF/ELIF/Else Basics
- check example.py

WHILE and FOR loop
- if you know how long you want the list to be (For loop)
- if you dont know?(while)


List or Disct or structure
- basically an array
- O = "ORDER of complexity"
- O(1) = "constant order"
- O(n) = "Linear"
- O(n^2) = 

List:
- ordered, duplicates allowed

Dict: (dictionary)
- Key-value pairs
- super fast
- hashable keys (takes only one lookup to get the right value)
- unorderded (key value, so a key o each value)

Set:
- unique values(can only be diffrent)
- also unorderded
- lookup is the same as Dict(you only need one operation)
- dont use if its important the order

Depending on how you want to store the data, you want a different one
- List if you need duplicates, and order in the files
- Dict if you need flexibility and key value lookup, doesnt matter if its ordered
-  they have different performance
- List, it takes as many iterations as there are elements
- Dict and Set take only one tep to find the item


QUIZ:
1. remove duplicates and check members quickly (use Set)
2. look up patient info fast (Dict has value pairs and if fast, supposrts complex structure)
3. order matters + duplicates allowed (List, ordered and allowa the same values)
